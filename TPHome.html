                Introduction
            </h2>

            <p class="intro">
                Teachers are one of the most underappreciated professions in America. K-12 teachers 
                constantly need to be thinking about things we as laymans never consider, and because we 
                don't normally need to consider them, they never are addressed and the teachers are never 
                given their due credit. We at Teacher's Pet thought that we could try and help these teachers 
                out a little bit. We are developping an application for teachers to use in class on their tablets or 
                smartphones which will be an easy-to-use teaching aid.

                Features
            </h2>


            <ul>
                <li><h3>Student Profiles</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Each student is special and each student is different. Our product will allow teachers 
                        to, at the beginning of a term, enter in their class roster(s). Once this is done the 
                        application will create individule profiles for each student which can be updated by the 
                        teacher to include information such as who the student works well or poorly with, if 
                        they have been misbehaving, and if they need extra attention.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Seating Chart Generator</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Teachers most of the time have seating charts in their classrooms, and these seating 
                        charts cannot just be thrown together. There are certain parameters that need to be 
                        addressed by the teacher when making a seating chart. This application will take these 
                        parameters into account via the student profiles. There is also sometimes a need for a 
                        teacher to have multiple seating charts such as seats on the floor for young students or 
                        seats in a computer lab or music room. Our product will take all these things into 
                        account via the student profiles and generate one or more seating charts for a teacher 
                        quickly and easily. The app will also allow for the teacher to input their classroom's 
                        desk formation which will further personalize the seating chart and more accurately 
                        place students.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Group Randomizer</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Similar paramters taken into account when creating a seating chart exist when trying to 
                        choose groups or pairs in a class. This product will do this for the teachers and create 
                        random pairings that work well with the students.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Random Student Selection</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes teachers need to choose a random student to do some task. Some teachers 
                        "randomly" point to a spot on a roster list or a seating chart or "randomly" choose a 
                        popsicle stick from a jar. These methods are not completely random, so we wanted to 
                        give teachers an easy way to select a student at random. This tool will also display the 
                        student's name large on the screen so that students, especially young students, can 
                        clearly see whose turn it is to talk.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Attendance Tool</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Our product will give teachers an easy and mobile way to take attendance. The teacher 
                        will be able to tap on each student that is absent and it will record and save that data.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Classroom Chores Assigner</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        Some teachers have systems where students are chosen at random to do certain tasks 
                        around the classroom, and these students will change each day, week, month, etc. Our 
                        application will choose these students randomly without replacement. This will take 
                        away the possibility of one student having a chore every rotation or one student never 
                        having a chore.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Help Button</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        This application will not only be used by teachers. One problem a lot of students face 
                        is shyness and insecurity about not knowing something or having a question. We 
                        wanted a way to work around that insecurity while still making sure each student gets 
                        the help and instruction they need. The solution is a student version of the application 
                        which will connect with each class they're in and allow them to press a button on their 
                        phone which alerts their teacher that they have a question so they don't have to ask in 
                        front of the class.
