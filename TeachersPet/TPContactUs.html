                Scott Maxa
            </h2>
            <p>
                Scott is a sophomore Computer Science and 
                Mathematics major at Whitworth University in 
                Spokane, WA. He is a practicing wizard. 
                Stemming from his skills in math, Scott 
                decided to try out computer science. 
                He learned some Python and created a Pig Latin 
                translator which excited him for more 
                computer science in college. In his first year 
                and a half of college he has become proficient 
                in C++ and has dabbled in HTML and 
                JavaScript. For this product he will do a lot
                of the coding. Scott is in charge of the main 
                programming portions of the application 
                and will do his best to help with 
                the design elements.
