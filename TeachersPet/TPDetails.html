                Problem
            </h2>
            <p class="intro">
                There are many problems facing teachers that we are trying to solve. The overarching problem 
                is that teachers are underappreciated and under-accommodated, so we wanted to help them 
                with the little problems that they face all the time and make their lives a little bit easier. These 
                "little" problems seem little to us but to teachers they are yet more things heaped onto their 
                already full plates. The features in this application strive to make these tasks easier and faster.

            <h2>
                Target Audience
            </h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Our target audience is teachers. Most of our features are tailored toward middle school/junior 
                high school and high school teachers, but can be extremely helpful to elementary school 
                teachers. We are targeting "teachers" as opposed to "professors" although, depending on the 
                professor and the class structure, our features could be useful for them also. Basically anyone 
                who has a class will find our application useful for at least one of our features.

            <h2>
                Device Requirements
            </h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Ideally, every teacher will have access to a tablet. Tablets are mobile, they are personalizable, 
                they are multi-use machines, they are small enough to carry around, yet they are more 
                professional than carrying around a smartphone. When a teacher is looking at a phone you can 
                never be sure if they are doing work-related or personal activities. If a teacher has a specific 
                tablet that is issued by the school and is to be used only for work-related activities there is no 
                question why a teacher is using it. It is not realistic for every teacher that wants to use our 
                product to have a tablet, so we will also offer a smartphone version of the application along 
                with our tablet version. This smartphone version will also be used by students for the Help 
                Button function.
            </p>

            <h2>
                System Requirements
            </h2>
            <p class="intro">
                The main requirement this application will have is the ability to store data. It needs to be able 
                to store data on every student and every class this teacher has. Another requirement is access 
                to bluetooth connections from the teacher's tablet or smartphone to the students' smartphones. 
                The product will not require web connectivity because everything it needs will have been input 
                manually by the teacher.
